cus·tom·ar·y

_/ˈkəstəˌmerē/_

_adjective_

1. according to the customs or usual practices associated with a particular
society, place, or set of circumstances.

This package prevents HTML forms from submitting by hooking in to and preventing
their `submit` event.

This means that [native validation](https://caniuse.com/#feat=form-validation)
can be leveraged, and a callback passed to the function can handle the form
after it has already been validated by the browser.
